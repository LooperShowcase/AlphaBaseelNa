            If you've chosen to build a work PC, we recommend budget-friendly parts. While buying a pre-built PC might be easier, we're here to help you build one yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, you'll need a CPU, GPU, and motherboard. For the CPU, we suggest the Ryzen 3 4100 for its cost-effectiveness and great performance for work tasks. The AMD RX 550 GPU provides versatility for various PC uses.
        </p>
        <p>
            When choosing a motherboard, ensure it's compatible with the CPU and has DDR4 slots. Other components you'll need include a PSU (around 500W is sufficient), a case of your choice, 8GB of 2400MHz RAM, and the CPU cooler included in the CPU box.
        </p>
