        if you picked this kind of pc's i would recomend a mid tier pc <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        you have to pick the holy trinity of your pc :<br />
        Motherboard <br />
        cpu<br />
        gpu<br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>
        
          for an amd pc Motherboard i would recomend a msi one bc their the best
          in motherboards but check if its copatible with the cpu

      </p>

      
      <p>
        cpu: i would recomend a ryzen 5 5600x because its often in sale and its
        a top tier cpu for budget builds</p>
      
        <br /><br />
        <img

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        gpu: for the gpu its going to cost you an arm and a leg but for amd
        builds you have the rx series that has a great performance for the cost
        so i would recomend a rx 6600 <br>
        but if you play fortnite as your main game i would recomend a Nvidia driver
        because amd drivers run badly with fortnite so a RTX 3060 would work best

    <p>
      now you need a psu, case, ram,cpu cooler or aio , aditional fans(depends on pc case)
    </p>
    <p>
      for this kind of pcs you dont need more than a 650W psu but if your looking to upgrade pc parts
       later buy a 750W not more
    </p>
    <p>
      the case has to be compatible with the mother board so an atk case is best but look for 
      a case with 2 intake fans and one exhaust or more 
    </p>
    <p>
      the ram is really important so you have to look for 2 things in your ram properties <br>
      <u class="ram-list">
        <li>mhz</li>
        <li>gb size</li>
      </ol>      
      <br>
      i would recommend 3200hz or more and 16GB RAM or more and that its ddr4 bc you dont need ddr5 in a budget pc
    </p>
    
    <p>
      a cpu cooler is really important because it keeps your cpu cooled while you gaming so buy a good one 
      or you can step up your pc game and buy an aio that is atached to 1/2/3 fans but it is going to cost you
    </p>
    <p>
      so if you feel that you need even more fans you can buy some more intake + exhaust fans but
       dont buy one fan kind without buying the other
